          Similar to hackathons, datathons provide students an opportunity to
          explore <br />
          the vast world of data by working on a data science project related to
          a real-world issue.

            From April 15th to April 16th, Data @ UCI hosted EMBARK, our very
            first Datathon! We were thrilled to see so many talented students
            participate and showcase their data analysis skills! Their
            enthusiasm and dedication brought a new level of energy to the
            event. All throughout the day, participants worked hard on their
            projects making great progress on their presentations and submission
            posts.
            <br />
            <br />
            We would like to extend a special to thank our workshop hosts for
            sharing their expertise and providing valuable insights to our
            participants, and thank you to our members for coming together and
            being a part of EMBARK! Additionally, we would like to shoutout to
            our incredible sponsors for their invaluable support and
            contributions to EMBARK 2023! A special thank you to UCI Office of
            Data and Information Technology, Melissa Data, MathWorks,
            Stratascratch, Crowdstrike, UCI Antrepreneur Center, Guayaki,
            Notion, and Quokka for making this event a huge success.
